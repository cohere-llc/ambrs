"""emissions -- aerosol (and potentially gas) emissions and background inputs

We use frozen AerosolModalSizeState objects to define the emitted size distributions.

At this point, we are treating aerosol background and emissions the same way, which works for PartMC, but we may want a separate class for background later.
